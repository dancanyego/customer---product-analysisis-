From the results, It seems that more classic/vintage cars are more in high demand. Having the 1968 Ford Mustand being the 
number one highest-demand product following the Mercedes-Benz SSK and 1997 BMW F650 ST. We can also take away that our top
VIP customers come from Spain, the USA, Australia, and France with the most profitable coming from Diego Freyre from Spain and 
close-second with two customers who come from the USA with 5.46% combined difference in profit (236769.39 + 72370.09). Our
least engaged customers hits it's lowest with the USA, Italy, France, and the UK with the lowest of 2610.87 and the 'high' of 10868.03. 
Lastly using the top_five CTE I created I was able to calculate the Customer Lifetime Value to 39039.594388 which can be used
to predict future profit and acquire new customers.
